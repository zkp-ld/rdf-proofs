# rdf-proofs

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

This library is designed to facilitate the attachment of BBS+ signatures to RDF graphs, enabling the issuance of Verifiable Credentials.
It also supports the aggregation of multiple Verifiable Credentials and allows for selective disclosure of their components.
This results in the creation of Verifiable Presentations in the form of RDF datasets.
The library utilizes the BBS+ signature scheme and proof-system library from [docknetwork/crypto](https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto).

**⚠️ Experimental Phase**: This library is currently in an experimental phase and is not recommended for use in production environments.

## Using the Library

To use this library without building it from source, ensure that Rust is installed on your system.
You can install it by running the following command in your project directory:

```shell
cargo add rdf-proofs
```

## Usage
