# rdf-proofs

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

This library enables the attachment of BBS+ signatures to RDF graphs to create Verifiable Credentials.
It allows for the combination of multiple Verifiable Credentials and provides the capability to selectively disclose specific parts, resulting in the generation of a Verifiable Presentation as an RDF dataset.
Internally, it utilizes the BBS+ signature library and the proof-system library from [docknetwork/crypto](https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto).
Note that this is still in an experimental phase and is not suitable for practical use.

## Usage
