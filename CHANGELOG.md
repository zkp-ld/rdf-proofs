# Changelog

## [0.10.0-alpha.0] - 2024-08-23

### Changed

- **BREAKING** Changed key encoding format from `base64url` to `base58btc` + `multicodecs`
- **BREAKING** Replaced PPID representation with `did:key` instead of `ppid:`
- **BREAKING** Upgraded `docknetwork/crypto` libraries (`proof_system`, `bbs_plus`, `dock_crypto_utils`, `legogroth16`) resulting in breaking changes in several cryptographic objects
- Updated `oxrdf`, `oxttl`, `rdf-canon`, and other dependencies

### Fixed

- Separated zk-SNARK proving keys and verifying keys in several test cases

## [0.9.1-alpha.4] - 2024-03-18

### Changed

- Adjusted the input conditions for `derive_proof` to correctly exclude invalid input patterns
- Added verification rule for rejecting VP with empty statements
- Improved formatting

## [0.9.1-alpha.3] - 2024-03-18

### Changed

- Upgraded `oxrdf`, `oxttl`, and `rdf-canon` dependencies

## [0.9.1-alpha.2] - 2024-03-18

### Changed

- Relax the input conditions for `derive_proof` to allow deriving VP without VCs but only with PPID

## [0.9.1-alpha.1] - 2024-01-11

### Fixed

- Increased the previously insufficient vector capacity in `signature::hash` function

### Changed

- Upgraded `oxrdf`, `oxttl`, `oxsdatatypes`, `oxiri`, and `rdf-canon` from GitHub sources to pre-release versions on crates.io
- Published pre-release version on crates.io
- Updated README

## [0.9.0] - 2023-10-18

### Added

- Predicate proofs generation and verification

### Changed

- The way of hashing terms with datatype of `xsd:date`, `xsd:dateTime`, `schema:Date`, `schema:DateTime`, and `xsd:integer` to allow range proofs
- Upgrade dependencies

## [0.8.1] - 2023-10-02

### Changed

- change `proofPurpose` of VP from `assertionMethod` to `authentication` to align with the spec

## [0.8.0] - 2023-09-28

### Added

- Blind signing feature
- PPID feature
- `domain` parameter to `derive_proof` and `verify_proof`
- Allow inclusion of committed secrets in VP, generated by `derived_proof`, for using VP as an issuance request for bound VC
- Helper functions for mutual conversion between ark object and multibase
- Set current datetime for `created` if not provided
- Type aliases to abstract cryptographic structs like `Bls12_381`, `SignatureParamsG1`, and so forth

### Changed

- Rename `nonce` to `challenge`
- Modify `sign`, `sign_string`, `blind_sign`, `blind_sign_string` to generate the entire proof, not just the proof value
- Simplify serialization and deserialization of proofValue (`ProofWithIndexMap`) and serialization of proof spec context (`ProofSpecContext`)
