# Changelog

## [0.8.0] - 2023-09-28

### Added

- Blind signing feature
- PPID feature
- `domain` parameter to `derive_proof` and `verify_proof`
- Allow inclusion of committed secrets in VP, generated by `derived_proof`, for using VP as an issuance request for bound VC
- Helper functions for mutual conversion between ark object and multibase
- Set current datetime for `created` if not provided
- Type aliases to abstract cryptographic structs like `Bls12_381`, `SignatureParamsG1`, and so forth

### Changed

- Rename `nonce` to `challenge`
- Modify `sign`, `sign_string`, `blind_sign`, `blind_sign_string` to generate the entire proof, not just the proof value
- Simplify serialization and deserialization of proofValue (`ProofWithIndexMap`) and serialization of proof spec context (`ProofSpecContext`)
